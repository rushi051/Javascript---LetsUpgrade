    <h2>Number:<br></h2>
    <p>
        The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br>

            There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division , addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
    </p>

    <h2>BigInt :</h2>
     <p>
       In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(-253-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.
     </p>

     <h2>String :</h2>
     <p>
        A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
     </p>

     <h2>Boolean</h2>
     <p>
        The boolean type has only two values: true and false.<br>

        This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
     </p>

     <h2>Null Value</h2>
     <p>
        The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.<br>

        It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:
     </p>
     <h2>Undefined value:</h2>
        <p>
            The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.<br>

            The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
        </p>
     <h2>Object</h2>
        <p>
            The object type is special.<br>

All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
        </p>
        <h2>Symbol :</h2>
        <p>
            The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.
