    <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.<br>
        var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared<br> const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
        They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.<br>

        While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</p>
